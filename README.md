## Introduction

This repository provides implementations of the following CNN models utilizing eye diseases classification dataset:

- EfficientNet B3
- Custom CNN
- AlexNet
- GoogLeNet (Inception v1)
- MobileNet
- VGG-16
- VGG-19
- ResNet (ResNet50)

These models are widely used for image classification tasks and serve as a good starting point for understanding different CNN architectures.

## Models Included

### EfficientNet B3
EfficientNet is a family of models that uniformly scale all dimensions of depth, width, and resolution using a compound coefficient.

### Custom CNN
A simple custom CNN model designed for educational purposes to demonstrate the basic building blocks of convolutional neural networks.

### AlexNet
AlexNet is a deep convolutional neural network that was designed by Alex Krizhevsky and won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge in 2012.

### GoogLeNet (Inception v1)
GoogLeNet, also known as Inception v1, introduced the Inception module and won the ILSVRC 2014 classification challenge.

### MobileNet
MobileNet is a family of lightweight deep neural networks designed for mobile and embedded vision applications.

### VGG-16
VGG-16 is a deep convolutional network for large-scale image recognition, notable for its simplicity and use of very small (3x3) convolution filters.

### VGG-19
VGG-19 is similar to VGG-16 but with three additional convolutional layers, making it deeper and slightly more accurate.

### ResNet (ResNet50)
ResNet50 is a 50-layer deep convolutional neural network known for introducing residual connections, which help in training very deep networks.
